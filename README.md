 ## OVERVIEW

 <p style="text-indent"> (Analyze-Basophils-Eosinophils.R) will allow you to load a comma-delimited .csv with various datapoints, perform single regressions of Body Mass Index (BMI) vs. Basophils and Body Mass Index (BMI) vs. Eosinophils from the Complete Blood Count with Differential (CBC-D) results, and produce 2-D scatterplots, and boxplots for the results.
 
<p style="text-indent: 160px"> Data (RobinsonEtAl_Sup1.csv) was downloaded from: 
Robinson, JM. et al. 2019. Complete blood count with differential: An effective diagnostic for IBS subtype in the context of BMI? BioRxiv. doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/608208. 
      Normal ranges were obtained from: https://idph.iowa.gov/Portals/1/Files/IMMTB/Complete%20Blood%20Count.pdf

  * BASOPHILS: Definition & range
  
    Basophils appear in many specific kinds of inflammatory reactions, particularly those that cause allergic symptoms. Basophils contain anticoagulant heparin, which prevents blood from clotting too quickly. its normal range is [0.002-0.02 μg/dL.]

*   EOSINOPHILS: Definition & range
  
     Eosinophils are a type of disease-fighting white blood cell. Their presence often indicates a parasitic infection, an allergic reaction, or cancer. You can have high levels of eosinophils in your blood (blood eosinophilia) or in tissues at the site of an infection or inflammation (tissue eosinophilia). Its normal range is [0.004-0.04 μg/dL.]

### RESULTS OF SINGLE REGRESSION, BMI x BASOPHILS 
```
> single.regression <- lm(BMI ~ Basophils, data=IBS1)
> print(single.regression)

Call:
lm(formula = BMI ~ Basophils, data = IBS1)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)    Basophils  
      27.22       -15.31  

```
```
ggplot(IBS1, aes(x=BMI, y=Basophils)) +
  geom_point() +    
  geom_smooth(method=lm)

#  <p align = "center"> Additional Lines of Code
 
   <p style="text-indent"> (Basophil-Eosinophil-finalproject.R) will allow you to load a comma-delimited .csv with various datapoints, perform single regressions and anova of each gene expressed in the .csv file vs. Basophils or vs. Eosinophils.
   
   In addition, (Basophil-Eosinophil-finalproject.R) will  allow to perform a recursive analysis for regression which creates a date frame list to store all the genes necessary for the analysis. Transformations such as log2 FC and -log10 will be combined and exported to create a volcanoplot which computes the signfiance of each gene is relevance to the analysis being perfomred.
