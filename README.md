## <p align="center"> * Basophils* </p>
>## Basophils appear in many specific kinds of inflammatory reactions, particularly those that cause allergic symptoms. Basophils contain anticoagulant heparin, which prevents blood from clotting too quickly. They also contain the vasodilator histamine, which promotes blood flow to tissues. its normal rages is 0.002-0.02 Î¼g/dL.

### Results of single regression, BMI x Basophils
```
> single.regression <- lm(BMI ~ Basophils, data=IBS1)
> print(single.regression)

Call:
lm(formula = BMI ~ Basophils, data = IBS1)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)    Basophils  
      27.22       -15.31  

```
```
ggplot(IBS1, aes(x=BMI, y=Basophils)) +
